                <h2>Quiet Beginnings</h2>
                <p>Not sure what's "wrong" with me but as long as I can remember I've had a profound and abiding love for "non-musical" sounds. 
                    My mom tells me when I was little I would "sing" along with the hum of the refridgerator and flush the toilet over and over again and dance around to the resulting noise.</p>
                <h2>Bigger kicks, Louder Sounds</h2>
                <p>A little later when I had some money of my own, I could often be found at the Streetside and the corner of Grand and Arsenal.
                    It was during that time I picked up Public Enemy cassette "It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back."
                    The whole thing was chock full of screaching sirens, breaking glass and deep rumbling bass. I was in love instantly.</p>
                <h2>So Raw, So Pure</h2>
                <p>For most of my adolescence the hunt for weird noise being used in popular music was a consuming and fruitless endeavor.
                    I would often find myself listening to the squarest music for the little bit at the end of the track where the band gets a little loose and freaky.
                    This typically would occur right before the track would fade out so essentially I would be listening to 4 minute pop songs for aproximately 5 seconds of sound I was interested in.
                    But then file-sharing happened and I discovered The Velvet Underground, Throbbing Gristle and Merzbow. I haven't looked back since.</p>
